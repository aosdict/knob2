Spawn new threads for hook functions. (Make multithreaded a setting for the bot)
Concept of privilege levels (at least 2): anyone can use the lowest level but only certain users/nicks can run commands at higher levels
List of nicks who are privileged
Maintain a dictionary of channel names to lists of nicks on those channels. This should be its own complete extension. It would involve hooking PART, NICK, JOIN, QUIT, NAMES commands.
Settings to control printing of certain messages to the console, like say results.
Prepend eventual project name to extension module and class.
Document how extensions can communicate with each other. They can be initialized with each other's instances.
More commands for the user on command line.
Extension to say something when bot joins a channel (either first channel or any channel)
Extension class defines a print function that will print "(Extension Name) " followed by the rest of the message.
Add setting to bot to control level of printing "unhandled" IRC messages: 0 = never print, 1 = print only if nothing handled it, 2 = print if something handled it but let it fall through, 3 = always print
