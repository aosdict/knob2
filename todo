Main bot:
Spawn new threads for hook functions. (Make multithreaded a setting for the bot) (Maybe don't want to do this because hooks/extensions may want to stop other ones from executing)
Document how extensions can communicate with each other. They can be initialized with each other's instances. (Though I would say it would be generally a bad practice to have extensions communicating.)
More commands for the user on command line.
Change console quit so it actually sends a QUIT and allows the user to give a quit message
Should the bot know what channels it's currently on, or is that better off as an extension?

General extensions stuff:
Prepend eventual project name to extension module and class, rather than "Extension".
Extensions should print a line to console when initialized

New planned extensions:
Extension to say something when bot joins a channel (either first channel or any channel)
Maintain a dictionary of channel names to lists of nicks on those channels. This should be its own complete extension. It would involve hooking PART, NICK, JOIN, QUIT, NAMES commands.
facts: responds to <word>? messages and !randomfact with quotes that have isare defined on them

Karma Tracker:
Allow a command for users to alias their nick to another nick (needs careful consideration on how to prevent people aliasing to an existing other person)
Notify people who try to karma spam in a private message. (should be a setting)
If someone karma spams too much, put them on a blocked list who can't karma people anymore (should be a setting)

Command Handler:
Concept of privilege levels (at least 2): anyone can use the lowest level but only certain users/nicks can run commands at higher levels
List of nicks who are privileged

Sundry Commands:
QUIT, PART, and distinction for JOIN, PART, and QUIT between this user and other users
Add option to use normal print instead of self.print (extension print) to remove (Sundry Commands) from everything.
MODE
