Main bot:
Spawn new threads for hook functions. (Make multithreaded a setting for the bot)
Document how extensions can communicate with each other. They can be initialized with each other's instances. (Though I would say it would be generally a bad practice to have extensions communicating.)
More commands for the user on command line.
Add setting to bot to control level of printing "unhandled" IRC messages: 0 = never print, 1 = print only if nothing handled it, 2 = print if something handled it but let it fall through, 3 = always print
Change console quit so it actually sends a QUIT and allows the user to give a quit message

General extensions stuff:
Prepend eventual project name to extension module and class, rather than "Extension".
Extension class defines a print function that will print "(Extension Name) " followed by the rest of the message.

New planned extensions:
Extension to say something when bot joins a channel (either first channel or any channel)
Maintain a dictionary of channel names to lists of nicks on those channels. This should be its own complete extension. It would involve hooking PART, NICK, JOIN, QUIT, NAMES commands.

Karma Tracker:
Add optionally printing message when karma is changed
Add !karma command to make the bot return the karma amount for a user

Command Handler:
Concept of privilege levels (at least 2): anyone can use the lowest level but only certain users/nicks can run commands at higher levels
List of nicks who are privileged
