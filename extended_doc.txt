Encircle Extended Documentation

Dependencies
============
This client requires Python 2 to run and needs the Python curses library as well (which you may have as part of your Python installation.)

Filters
=======
Encircle has a number of filters which apply to specific kinds of messages. The main reason is that these aren't the type of thing that most people probably want to see. Message types can belong to multiple filters, and if a message is caught by any filter, it will not be shown.
These are the filters defined in Encircle:
Server statistics: information about the network that is typically sent automatically when you connect. This filter is on by default.
  002 - server host IP/name
  003 - server creation time
  004 - server version and permitted user and channel modes
  005 - server's list of things it supports
  219 - end of server stats list
  242 - server uptime
  250 - connection statistics
  251 - users/servers online
  252 - operators online
  253 - number of unknown connections
  254 - number of channels
  255 - number of clients/servers
  265 - local users (nonstandard, freenode)
  266 - global users (nonstandard, freenode)
Message Of The Day: message sent by a server to all newly connecting clients. This filter is on by default.
  372 - motd body
  375 - motd header
  376 - end of motd
Nonstandard: any message not defined in either RFC 1459 or RFC 2812. Several are widely used, though. This filter is on by default.
  265 - freenode's local users statistic
  266 - freenode's global users statistic
  330 - <user> is logged in as <X>
  378 - freenode's WHOIS host response
  379 - freenode's WHOIS modes
  671 - person is using a secure connection
Begins and Ends: messages that are sent before and after a body of other messages, like a names list or channel list. This filter is on by default.
  219 - end of server stats list
  318 - end of WHOIS list
  321 - beginning of channel list
  323 - end of channel list
  366 - end of channel names list
  368 - end of channel ban list
  369 - end of WHOWAS list
  375 - motd header
  376 - end of motd
  706 - end of help page
  
Initialization options not covered elsewhere
============================================
--raw-output: Do no formatting to incoming messages from the server. Raw IRC messages can be messy, so this is not recommended except for debugging.
--raw-commands: Do no formatting to user input and send all messages unprocessed to the server. IRC command syntax can be messy and tedious to type out, so this is not recommended except for debugging.
--show-server-stats: Disable the default blocking filter for server statistics.
--show-motd: Disable the default blocking filter for the message of the day.
--show-nonstandard: Disable the default blocking filter for nonstandard messages.
--show-begins-and-ends: Disable the default blocking filter for begin or end messages.
--hide-pings: Enable the blocking filter for pings
